:muscle: Got some thought recently.

There is a book named <西国记法>, a pretty interested book. I applied some methods in this book into reciting poems.
And it does work. Haha.

About palace, I think to define your own palace is the hardest and the most important part of this method.

I wanna use gamification to help my user to define this.

Sounds cool ha? ^_^
